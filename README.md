# Elevator System Backend

This project implements a simplified Elevator System backend using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). It allows you to manage multiple elevators, handle elevator requests, and determine the optimal elevator to serve user requests.

## Features

- Initialize the elevator system with 'n' elevators.
- Fetch all requests for a given elevator.
- Fetch the next destination floor for a given elevator.
- Fetch if the elevator is currently moving up or down.
- Save user requests to the list of requests for an elevator.
- Mark an elevator as not working or in maintenance.
- Open/close the elevator door.
